Hello everyone! I make little things that could potentially help people in the future. I don't usually do big projects unless I'm really dedicated to it or I really need it.



About me!

I mostly play Minecraft on a server called Jartex where I preform staff duties and I'm quite competitive in games like Factions and Bedwars/Skywars although unfortunately I've stopped playing Skywars due to an unhealthy obsession towards it and something else which is personal. Whenever I'm not on Jartex, I'm either sleeping, Writing something on Visual Studio Code, Watching a film or talking to my friend Smilte although I call them "Homework person" to other people on Jartex.
